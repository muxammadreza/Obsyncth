# iOS Troubleshooting Guide for Obsyncth

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Encryption Mismatch Error
**Error**: `"remote expects to exchange encrypted data, but is configured for plain data"`

**Root Cause**: Different devices have inconsistent encryption settings for the same folder.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Device Analysis**: Use "üî¨ Deep Device Analysis" to identify which devices have mismatched encryption
2. **Force Consistency**: Use "‚ö° Force Consistent Encryption" to make all devices use the same settings
3. **Manual Fix**: Ensure all devices have identical encryption settings in the Configuration tab

### 2. iOS Hidden File Access

**Problem**: iOS cannot see or sync the `.obsidian` folder due to sandboxing.

**Solutions**:
1. **Use the iOS Folder Picker**: In settings, click "üìÅ Choose Folders to Sync"
2. **Select "Entire Vault"**: This includes hidden folders like `.obsidian`
3. **Enable "Sync hidden files"**: Check this option in iOS Compatibility settings
4. **Vault Location**: Ensure your vault is in a Files app accessible location:
   - iCloud Drive/Obsidian/
   - On My iPhone/Obsidian/
   - Documents folder

### 3. Working Copy App Approach

The plugin implements the same file access strategy as Working Copy:

1. **Document Provider Extensions**: Access files through iOS document provider
2. **Custom File Picker**: Shows hidden folders that standard iOS pickers hide
3. **Proper Sandboxing**: Respects iOS security while accessing necessary files
4. **Files App Integration**: Uses extended permissions to access hidden folders

### 4. Deep Configuration Analysis

Use these tools to diagnose issues:

- **üîç Check & Fix Encryption Mismatch**: Basic encryption consistency check
- **üî¨ Deep Device Analysis**: Comprehensive device and folder analysis
- **üßπ Remove Hardcoded Encryption**: Clears any forced encryption settings
- **‚ö° Force Consistent Encryption**: Nuclear option to force all devices to match

### 5. iOS Setup Checklist

‚úÖ Vault in Files app accessible location  
‚úÖ Remote Syncthing URL configured  
‚úÖ Same encryption settings on all devices  
‚úÖ Hidden files sync enabled  
‚úÖ Folder picker used to select sync folders  
‚úÖ "Force consistent encryption" enabled  

### 6. Advanced Troubleshooting

If the error persists:

1. **Check Device IDs**: Ensure all devices are properly paired
2. **Restart Syncthing**: On all devices after making changes
3. **Clear Configuration**: Remove and re-add folders with consistent settings
4. **Server Logs**: Check Syncthing logs on your Linux server for detailed errors

### 7. Mobile Mode vs Desktop Mode

- **iPad (Mobile Mode)**: Connects remotely to server, cannot run local Syncthing
- **Mac (Desktop Mode)**: Runs local Syncthing instance, can share folders
- **Linux Server**: Runs Syncthing server, manages folder sharing

Ensure all three use the same encryption settings for shared folders.
